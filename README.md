## 📂 Repository Structure

- [`Prompt Methods`](prompts/README.md)  
  Explore categorized prompt techniques such as zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role prompting, and more — all backed with practical examples and explanations.

- [`Tools Used`](tools/README.md)  
  A breakdown of the platforms, libraries, and frameworks used in designing, testing, and optimizing prompts (e.g. LangChain, OpenAI API, PromptLayer, etc.).

- [`Responsible AI`](responsible-ai/README.md)  
  My approach to ethical AI usage: mitigating bias, ensuring safety, respecting user intent, and aligning with responsible AI development principles.

- [`Examples & Use Cases`](examples/README.md)  
  Real-world applications of prompt engineering across domains like content generation, education, code assistance, data analysis, and user experience design.
