# Prompt Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my **Prompt Engineering Portfolio**! This repository showcases a diverse collection of prompts that I’ve crafted, demonstrating my skills across various prompt engineering techniques.

## Contents

- [Prompt Methods](prompts/README.md) — Organized prompt examples by method  
- [Tools Used](tools/README.md) — Tools and frameworks for prompt development  
- [Responsible AI](responsible-ai/README.md) — Ethical considerations in prompt engineering  
- [Examples & Use Cases](examples/README.md) — Real-world applications of prompts  

## About Me

I specialize in crafting effective and responsible AI prompts, enabling language models to generate accurate, safe, and useful outputs.

Feel free to explore the prompts and reach out if you want to collaborate!
