🚀 Prompt Engineering Portfolio
Welcome to my Prompt Engineering Portfolio — a curated showcase of advanced prompt designs, techniques, and frameworks developed to unlock the full potential of large language models (LLMs).

Whether you're a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast, this repository provides hands-on examples and methodologies that demonstrate how thoughtful prompt engineering drives safer, smarter, and more effective AI outputs.

📂 Repository Structure
Prompt Methods
Explore categorized prompt techniques such as zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role prompting, and more — all backed with practical examples and explanations.

Tools Used
A breakdown of the platforms, libraries, and frameworks used in designing, testing, and optimizing prompts (e.g. LangChain, OpenAI API, PromptLayer, etc.).

Responsible AI
My approach to ethical AI usage: mitigating bias, ensuring safety, respecting user intent, and aligning with responsible AI development principles.

Examples & Use Cases
Real-world applications of prompt engineering across domains like content generation, education, code assistance, data analysis, and user experience design.
